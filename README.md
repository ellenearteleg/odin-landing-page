# odin-landing-page

This is my second project for The Odin Project, Foundations Learning Path.

We were tasked to create a landing page with several sections.

I followed the layout but made my own spin as if it was a landing page for a website that offers AI-powered writing solutions.

Everything on the page are made by myself, except for the photos.

It is still not 100& responsive, especially when it comes to the photos. I'm still learning on how I can make them resposnive and should make an update here down the line once I find out how I can do it best.
